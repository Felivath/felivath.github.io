title: "Welcome Adventurers!"

I'll be running a beginner-friendly D&D 5e campaign for tweens (Give or take a couple years). No experience is needed! I am happy to teach gameplay, and am available to help create characters if needed as well. I currently have 4 players between the ages of 9-15. They may not all always be able to make it though. With that in mind I am going to try and be running the game in such a way that players can show up one week and miss the next while still being able to follow stories and progression. I understand if players can't make it every week, and nobody wants to be a lower level than all their companions! So, we will have a party level that all characters will sync with. 

Characters are generally limited to base races and classes, as I don't own all the books, but if there's something from an official book your child really wants to play feel free to ask. I can try to find the book and see if it's acceptable. I'm not really open to homebrew at the moment though. I ask that everybody keep things kid friendly. Be nice, don't swear, hands to yourself unless you're high fiving/fist bumping. All the general "**be kind**" rules. 

Your child is not required to bring anything specific with them, but there are some items that might be nice to have. Dice are the main thing required to play, and while I do have extras, depending on how many people show up they might have to pass them around. So it would be nice if players had their own set to bring. The other required item is a character sheet. Those can be found and printed from <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf" target="_blank">https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf</a>. If you don't have access to a printer let me know, and I can print an extra ahead of time. A notebook or journal can be helpful to keep track of important events and characters, but isn't required.

Thanks for reading, and we look forward to meeting some new adventurers!
