##  Thanks Visiting
We’re running a **Dungeons & Dragons game** at the High Prairie Library. I'll be DMing for my kids between the ages of 9-16. If you'd like to sign your kid up please send me a text or email! I'll be happy to help them make a character, and I can teach them to play if they are new.

##  About the Game
A fun, beginner-friendly D&D campaign for tweens (Give or take a couple years). No experience needed! I'll be trying to run the game in such a way that players can show up one week and miss the next, but still be able to follow stories and progression. I understand if they can't make every session, and nobody wants to be a lower level than all their companions! So we will have a party level that all characters will sync with. Characters are generally limited to base races and classes, as I don't own all the books, but if there's something from an official book you really want to play feel free to ask. I can try and find the book and see if it's acceptable. Not really open to homebrew at the moment though. I ask that everybody keep things kid friendly. Be nice, don't swear, hands to yourself unless you're high fiving/fist bumping. General "**be kind**" rules.
