# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'll be hosting a Dungeons and Dragons game with my children at the local library. (We are not associate with them, just using their space)
  We are open to other players joining! If your kids would like to join in please reach out to me. Currently looking for others around my kids age. 
  So 9-16 would be great, but if you have someone who really wants to join outside of that range I'm open to discuss it! Please check out the Contact Me page to reach out with any questions.
